# Open NCBIRTH800mod dataset

Recall that the North Carolina State Center for Health Statistics makes
publicly available birth and infant death data for all children born in the
state of North Carolina. This comprehensive dataset for the births in 2001
contains 120,300 records. The data in ‘NCBIRTH800.sav’ represents a random
sample of 800 of those births and selected variables.

```{r}
library(haven)
ncbirth <- read_spss("~/Downloads/NCBIRTH800mod.sav")
```

In 2001, smoking prevalence among women in North Carolina was 23.1% (Tobacco
Prevention and Control Branch & State Center for Health Statistics, 2002,
p.2)^[Tobacco Prevention and Control Branch & State Center for Health
Statistics. (2002). BRFSS News Brief - North Carolina. Who’s Still Smoking in
NC? Retrieved from
http://www.tobaccopreventionandcontrol.ncdhhs.gov/data/SurveillanceDataFiles/ArchiveFactSheets/adult/AdultShortReports/brfssgaso02.pdf].

Conduct a two sided hypothesis test ($alpha_$ = .05) to determine if smoking
prevalence among pregnant women is different than that of the general female
population in North Carolina.

## State the null and alternative hypotheses:

Ho: p = .231
Ha: p ≠ .231

Would it be appropriate to conduct a “large sample” z test?

What is the sample size?

This shows you the dimensions of the data. The first number corresponds to
the rows and the second to the
columns. There are 800 observations
and 15 variables in the data.

```{r}
dim(ncbirth)
```

Create the frequency table and proportions table with `table` and `prop.table`
respectively.

```{r}
table(ncbirth$smoke, useNA = "always")
prop.table( table(ncbirth$smokef) )
```

Note that there are two values that are missing `NA` in our data.

Since n*p (`798 * .231`) and n*(1-p) (`798 * .769`) are both greater than 5, it
is ok to use the large-sample z-test to test the hypotheses of interest.

Based on the documentation of `?binom.test`, we want to have a tally of
successes and failures in that order. To get a tally we use the `table`
function and reverse the order with `rev` to arrange successes first.

```{r}
smokes <- rev(table(ncbirth$smoke))
zres <- prop.test(x = smokes, p = 0.231, alternative = "two.sided", correct = FALSE)
zres
```

Now we confirm that our probability of successes `p` matches the mean below:

```{r}
## mean should match prob. of success
mean(ncbirth$smoke, na.rm = TRUE)
```

To get the Z-test statistic, you take the square root of the `X-squared`
value in the output:

```{r}
sqrt(zres$statistic)
```

We know that our sample proportion, `0.142`, is less than the population
estimate `0.231` (smoking prevalence among women in NC) then we can conclude
that the Z-test statistic is *negative*, i.e., `r -sqrt(zres$statistic)`.

Remember to set the value of the `alternative` argument in the `prop.test`
function based on whether you are conducting a one-sided or two-sided test.


## Conclusion

Conclusion: Since p-value associated with this test is _p_ < .001 (which is
smaller than α = .05), we reject the null hypothesis `Ho: p = .231` in favor of
the alternative hypothesis `Ha: p ≠ .231`. We conclude that the proportion of
women in North Carolina who smoke while pregnant is not `.231`; in fact, we
found that it is significantly less (95% CI: .12, .17) (for CI see
`zres$conf.int`).

To calculate the standard error, we use the formula:

$sigma_{\bar{x}} = \sqrt{\frac{sigma^2}{n}}$

```{r}
sqrt(sd(ncbirth$smoke, na.rm = TRUE)^2 / 798)
```
